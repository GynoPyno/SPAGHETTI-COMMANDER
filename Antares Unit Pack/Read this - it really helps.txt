UNITMOD v0.24 (Now with added Balance for a more well-rounded experience!)

What is UNITMOD?

It's fourteen units. 

Is a man not entitled to the units he desires?
NO! Says the man at Gas Powered Games, they are for the expansion!
NO! Says the man on Fileplanet, they are for premium members only!
NO! Says the man in the Mod Developer forum, that will not work!
So I made UNITMOD. A pack where the experimental would not fear
power reduction, where the T3 unit would not be oppressed by the
T1!

Anyway, now Mr. Ryan is out of my system (really, play Bioshock. If
you can't play Bioshock find someone who can and bug them until they
let you), would you kindly read on to find out more!

These are:

UEF:
"Hacker" T1 Gunship*
"B-104 Armageddon" Flying Fortress*

Aeon:
"Obligation" T2 Siege Bomber*

Cybran:
"Kraken" Experimental Dreadnought*
"Terror" T3 Carpet Bomber*
"Strauss" T2 Howitzer*

* Has a custom model (amount of editing varies)

UEF
"Hacker" T1 Strafe Bomber
Fluff Text:
Our Commanders used to complain that Mech Marines couldn't hit jack from a transport. So we decided to put one of their guns on a stripped-down Wasp chassis, 
and see what happens. As it is, R&D fixed the MM's guns, but the Hacker proved so popular in tests we kept it around. It's weak but fast, and can tear light vehicles apart.

The real details: If UEF get a T2 and T3 gunship, why not give them a formal T1 one too! It's weak 
(50dps, but it rarely hits with every shot) but ludicrously fast and fun to use.

"B-104 Armageddon" Experimental Flying Fortress
Fluff Text:
Well we've gone a long time without something big and noisy to put in the air, Commander, but it's arrived. And it is big. We've put enough armour on this thing
to survive the thickest anti-air fire, and its bomb bays can put eight tactical nukes over a wide enough area for them to count. Now you won't be hunting ACUs with this thing,
it's not accurate enough. But if the enemy has buildings clustered together they can wave goodbye to the lot of them. And just in case anything pesky can evade these bombs,
by virtue of flying or being small, it has four Plasma Howitzers and a railgun to stop them dead.

We've even added a depth-charge to it to hunt subs.

The Real Details: Eight Ambassadors, a Stork and two Broadswords combine together, Power Rangers style, to form the ultimate turtle breaker. It can't hit anything smaller than a
Mex, or in fact anything that moves at all, but for smashing bases there's nothing better.

Cybran
Known issues:
NONE! THANKS PUREVENOM!

"Terror - T3 Suppression Bomber"
Fluff Text:
Even at the late stages of war, my boy, the enemy will still rely on massed tanks and fields of resource centres. 
They are fragile, are they not? So why waste a Strategic Bomber when you can carpet bomb the area and kill two birds with one stone!

The real details:
It's an alternative to the T3 Bomber which does massive area damage rather than focussed damage. 
So you can shield against it but if you've got a massive army a few of these will take it down in seconds. 
Likewise, protect your matrices! These things eat closely packed bases.

Known Issues:
None!

"Kraken - Experimental Dreadnought"
Fluff Text:
Why should those vile creatures, the Aeon, rule the seas with their battleship? Or why should the cursed UEF use their submarines and toys to sink our ships? 
The Kraken, my boy, is the answer! It is everything for a sea war. Its forward guns fire slowly but can tear through armour. 
Its rear mortars can go from firing to fully reloaded in seconds. 
Its sponson cannons are lifted from a Gunther. It can rip aircraft apart with its pair of flak guns, one a traditional projectile, the other a laser. 
Use the Kraken, my boy! Use it to own the seas!

The real details:
It's a naval experimental. It's got fore guns which are like three TMLs firing at once and rear guns which rapid-fire. 
Add to that torpedoes, flak guns and four sponson cannons and a secondary front gun for adding a little punch to a broadside and you've got 
76k HP of floating death (that's more than a Tempest). It can shoot across a 10km map with ease, but it takes a SCU 16 minutes to build, so you won't be massing them!

-----

"Strauss" - T2 Mobile Howitzer
Fluff Text:
The TML-6 is a thing of beauty, my boy. As is the Viper.

But missiles have a failing and that is that they can be intercepted. But a shower of shells from on high? It cannot! 
The Strauss can cover a chokepoint with shells without a second thought, so use it when the Viper cannot fulfil your needs.

The real details: It's a rapid fire T1 artillery with longer range and a larger splash. Great fun in large numbers.

"Obligation" T2 Airborne MML
Fluff Text:
The Evensong is...lacking, some Commanders say. So we have refined it into a more perfect, more harmonious form. 
We have taken the Serpentine missile and used it to replace the torpedo tube on a Skimmer in light of these complaints. 
It provides greater mobility and more chance of attacking behind enemy defences.

The Real Details: A FLYING MML! It's perfect for outwitting things like Buzzkills. What strategies could await?
