######## Madmax's unit mod ########

	This is my entry for the October 2020 unit competition, This adds a T3 spider assault bot to the Cybran line up, 
The idea was to make a spider unit that could attack anywhere, So it has the ability to climb up any cliff or mountain and it's amphibious to, 
Balance wise it is positioned between a loyalist and brick for damage, health and build costs, 

Unfortunatly this unit is still blocked by blocking terrain type.

Unit Lore Arachne

	Dr Brackman in his quest to create the Monkeylord and Megalith, started by first making smaller spider tanks this unit was one of his early experiments, 
it had long been buried in a secret abandoned research facility on Procyon. After the infinite war the Cybrans recolonised Procyon and discovered the facility, 
along with the buried and forgotten Arachne unit, the settlers quickly realising what they had found, informed the Cybran commanders of their discovery, 
the commanders saw potential in the old unit, and with a few modifications and updates, it was decided to add it to the tier 3 unit line up, 
what else was buried in that facility maybe more units will turn up the deeper we go.
