  This mod changes the ammo price for Strategic Missile Defense structures. This is useful to stand a chance against
  high powered AIx players.

Changes in V3.1, compared to version 3 (with UID 700cf1d2-5f0f-45be-8e1d-33a4e439083c):

- Blueprint loader hooks now.


Changes in V3, compared to version 2 (with UID 77778cf2-9b8b-11dc-8314-0800200c9a66):

- The projectile cost is now changed via a blueprint modification at load time. This is dynamic meaning that it works
  on all SMD units, not just the 4 of the main factions in V2. Also the new cost is not hardcoded but determined at
  load time. In other words: V3 works better with balance changes and other mods.
